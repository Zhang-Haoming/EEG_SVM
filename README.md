# EEG_SVM  
Thank you for come to this page.
This is a code base on method CSP to extract EEG features and method SVM to classify motor image (MI) EEG signal (left hand & right hand), the dataset is :BCI Competition 2008 â€“ Graz data set B, which you can download it at
http://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/

I provide 2 method for adjust parameters, GridSearch(complicated) and ShuffleSplit (simple), you can adjust parameter in main.py file.

This is my first EEG project, and I did it to warm up for another bigger project,  I did not do it very carefully, so it may contain some problem I did not found.
Now, the accurate rate could be around 80%.
