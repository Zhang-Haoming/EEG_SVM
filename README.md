# EEG_SVM
Thank you for go to this page.
This is a code base on SVM to classify motor image EEG signal (left hand & right hand), the dataset is :BCI Competition 2008 â€“ Graz data set B, which you can download it at
http://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/

I provide 2 method for adjust parameter, GridSearch(complicated) and ShuffleSplit (simple).

This is my first EEG project, and I did it to warm up for another bigger project, so I did not do it very careful, it may contain some problem I did not find.
Now, the accurate rate could be around 0.8.
